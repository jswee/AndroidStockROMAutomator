AndroidStockROMAutomator
========================

Automates the process of reseting an Android phone to stock ROM and recovery. Detects the phone plugged into the computer, locates and downloads the applicable ROMS and recovery images, pushes them to the device and does anything else necessary to reset a device to factory settings.

This is intended for use primarily by users who do not have technical expertise to otherwise complete the process manually. The goal is to reset the device to the factory ROM with minimal user interaction. Special parameters are available for advanced users.
